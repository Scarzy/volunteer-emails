Hi All,

This Saturday (18th) at 15:00 GMT we will be holding a 'doing' where we aim to work on the fourth module of this years game and our competition infrastructure (SRComp, OBS etc.). If you're at all interested in getting involved please do drop in, we'd love to see some new (or old!) faces ðŸ™‚.

Simply join the [Google Meet call][google_meet_link] to get stuck in!
