Hi All,

tl;dr We're kicking off SR2021 for volunteers in 2 weeks!

## Student Robotics 2021

Given the current state of the world, we doubt it'll be viable to run a *physical* robotics competition next year, so we're aiming for a virtual one.

## Competition kick-off meeting

We're going to hold the kick-off meeting the Thursday after next (October 8th) at 8:30pm UK time, the meet link is: https://meet.google.com/dwz-bosu-suh


Here's the current agenda:

- Discuss what to change for SR2021.
- Establish a competition timeline.
- Form a team that's interested in getting it running.
- Schedule regular meetings.

Please put it in your calendar!
