Hi All,

This coming Saturday (6th) at 14:00 GMT we'll have another 'doing', where we aim to work on the fourth module of this years game and our competition infrastructure (SRComp, OBS etc.).

We're always friendly to new members!

Just join our [Google Meet call][google_meet_link] on Saturday any time between 2pm-6pm and get stuck in!
