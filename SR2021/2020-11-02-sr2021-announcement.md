Hi All,

We're pleased to announce some details for Student Robotics 2021 - and we need your help to make it happen.

## Competition

Unfortunately, we are unable to run a physical competition in a safe way. Instead, we will be running a virtual competition in a simulated environment. The competition year will be very similar to what you're used to. In a few weeks, we'll kick off the competition with a kickstart, which will culminate in a final competition 1st May.

## Kickstart

Kickstart will be streamed live on **21st November 2020**. Here we'll announce the game for this year and go into further details on how the competition year will work.

## We need your help!

Student Robotics is nothing without its volunteers, and we need you to help make it happen! Whilst there's no in-person kickstart, competition or other events to organise, running a virtual competition brings its own challenges, and there's still a lot of work to do.

If you're interested in getting involved, whether by helping with development on our [competition simulator](https://github.com/srobo/competition-simulator), organising events, communicating with teams or anything else, we'd love to hear from you.

We'll be running an onboarding session on **5th November 2020** at 19:45 (UK time) for any potential volunteers, getting them familiar with the simulator, explaining how competitions will work this year, and of course answering any questions!

If you're interested in helping out, please come along! If you're interested in helping out but can't make that time, [let us know](competition-team@).

We look forward to seeing you then.
