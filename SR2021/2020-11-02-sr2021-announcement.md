Hi All,

We're pleased to announce some details for Student Robotics 2021 - and we need your help to make it happen.

## Competition

Unfortunately, we are unable to find a way to run a physical competition in a COVID safe way. Instead, following on from the success of our [previous virtual competition](https://studentrobotics.org/news/2020-07-25-post-competition/), we will be running the competition in a simulated environment. The competition's time scale will be very similar to what you're used to, with just a few short weeks until we'll kick off the competition with our Kickstart event. Teams will then have roughly 7 months to build their robot before the final competition on 1st May.

## Kickstart

[Kickstart](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2021/kickstart) will be streamed live on **21st November 2020**. Here we'll announce the game for this year and go into further details on how the competition year will work.

## We need your help!

Student Robotics is nothing without its volunteers! Whilst there's no in-person Kickstart, competition, or other events to organise, running a virtual competition brings its own challenges, and there's still so much to do. We need your help to make it happen!

If you're interested in getting involved with making the competition happen, whether by helping with development on our [competition simulator](https://github.com/srobo/competition-simulator), game design, organising events, communicating with teams or anything else, we'd love to hear from you.

We'll be running an onboarding session on **5th November 2020** at 19:45 (UK time) for all volunteers, getting them familiar with the simulator, explaining how events will work this year, and of course answering any questions!

If you're interested in helping out, please come along! If you're interested in helping out but can't make that time, [let us know](competition-team@studentrobotics.org).

We look forward to seeing you then.
