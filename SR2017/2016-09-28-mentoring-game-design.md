# Help us choose this year's game

Kickstart for SR2017 is almost upon us, and we need to design a game for the
year.  If you have a game idea, please let us know by emailing the following
details to <game-design@studentrobotics.org> by the end of the 2nd of October:

* A brief summary of your game (1-3 paragraphs)
* A diagram of the arena and any props within it (remember to include a legend!)
* A description of the scoring scheme.

After the submission deadline, your game idea will be presented to volunteers to
gather ideas on its strengths and weaknesses.  We'll then give you a chance to
comment on those criticisms, and will then select a game based on all of the
above.

# Mentor a team

Would you like to mentor a team and help them achieve their full potential in
this year's competition?  If so, please [register your interest][mentor-signup]
so that we can put you in touch with the Local Team Coordinator for your area.

In order to mentor, you should have some skills that will help to further a
team's learning and understanding of engineering, science or team work. For
example, you may be an engineering or science undergraduate, graduate or
professional (but please note that this is not an exhaustive list).

As a mentor, you will have a few responsibilities:

* Assisting your team by consulting them about issues they are having, or may
  have, relating to their involvement in the competition.
* You will regularly meet with your team.  This will likely be during or close
  to school hours i.e. 9am-4pm.  If you have a day job, then you should consider
  whether this commitment will be possible for you.
* Reporting to your supervisor (your Local Team Coordinator) when you've visited
  a team, as well as if you're unable to mentor your team for a significant
  period of time.

There are currently five Local Team Coordinators who each cover a geographical
area of the country.  They will be responsible for you as a mentor and will
hopefully be able to arrange social events throughout the year so you can meet
other mentors.

Think this is something you would like to be involved in?  We are looking to
allocate a mentor to each of our 54 teams, so we need as many of you to
volunteer as possible.  Get involved by [filling in this form][mentor-signup]
and help guide a team to success in this yearâ€™s competition!
