Hi,

The competition is getting nearer and there are many things to do, we have a large [list of tasks][task-list] which will need doing before the competition.
If you have some spare time and can give us a hand, your help would be much appreciated and will help us run an even better competition.
There are several ways you can get involved and help out.

## Southampton preparation day

We will be having a preparation day in Southampton on Saturday 2nd of March where we are planning on doing a load of the tasks.
We will be in Mountbatten (building 53) at the university on Level 4 from 10am onwards.
There will also be a social event in the evening, to be decided during the day.
There is a [rough agenda for the day][hack-day-agenda] which will be updated as more things are planned.

## Tech Day

Come along to the [tech day][techday-info] on the 9th in either London or Southampton where we will also be doing preparation for the competition along with assisting competitors.
If you are coming along let us know by [signing up to attend][techday-signup]).

## Take on a task on the task list.

You can also take on some tasks on the task list on GitHub.
Post a reply on the task so we know you are working on it,
Don't worry if you don't know everything about a task just ask in the task for any help you need.

## Competition signups

If you haven't [signed up for the competition][signup-form] yet there is still time to do so, we will be sending out information regarding accommodation and transport in the next couple of weeks.
Feel free to pass this onto others who might also be interested in helping out.
