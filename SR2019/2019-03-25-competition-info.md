Hi,

Thank you for volunteering to help at this year's Student Robotics competition!

The competition is fast approaching, so we thought it best to give you an update with everything you need to know.

The competition is going to be held at Southampton University's Student Union building (SUSU) over the weekend of the 6th-7th of April, though setup will start on Thursday 4th and teardown will finish on Monday 8th. When you signed up we asked for your availability over these dates if this has changed please let us know as soon as possible.

## Volunteer Roles

We've provisionally allocated your roles during the competition, you can see everyone's roles at:

- [Thursday (set-up day)](REDACTED)
- [Friday (set-up day)](REDACTED)
- [Saturday](REDACTED)
- [Sunday](REDACTED)

We have made [a very short summary of the roles](REDACTED), don't worry though, we'll be sending much more detailed documentation on how to perform each role very soon!

These schedules are likely to shift around between now and the competition, so make sure to check again closer to the competition (feel free to bookmark the pages). If you don't like or have questions on any of your assigned roles in any way, now's the time to speak out! Send an email to Andy at abarrett-sprot@studentrobotics.org and he'll try to cater for your preferences. Also if you're okay with commentating matches, please send him an email, as we're a bit short on commentators.

## Travel

We have some money set aside in the budget for reimbursing volunteer travel costs. We can't promise to reimburse everyone 100% of their costs but if you hold onto any receipts for petrol, train tickets or other travel purchases we'll do our best to make sure everyone is reimbursed fairly.


## Accommodation

If you're expecting accommodation, and haven't been contacted by us about your room, please let us know ASAP. We'll be sending final details (i.e. location) to you very soon.

## Arrival and Parking

Parking locations at the university can be found on [the website](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/competition/#parking). Unfortunately, on the setup and teardown days, free parking cannot be guaranteed, though it will be available over the Saturday and Sunday.

When you arrive head straight to SUSU (marked on the [parking map](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2019/competition/#parking) with the Student Robotics logo) and sign in at Reception. Depending on when you arrive, reception might not be set up. If this is the case, phone the competition phone on 07424603539.

Thanks again for volunteering to help, without you and the rest of our amazing volunteers we would not be able to run the competition. If you happen to know anyone who may be interested in helping at future competitions be sure to point them at our [volunteer sign up page](https://studentrobotics.org/volunteer).

See you at the competition!
