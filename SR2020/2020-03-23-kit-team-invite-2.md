Hi,

In light of the recent COVID-19 developments, we the Kit Team Committee are changing our priorities somewhat.  We are now opening up recruitment for the "Brain" and "Hardware Strategy" project teams.  If you are interested in joining either of these teams, please fill out [the sign-up form](https://forms.gle/QGX7ZBCEbxoiiL9e9) and we will get back to you.

If you are interested in helping to improve the platform that enables teams to build amazing robots and develop your own engineering skills, then do sign up to the [Brain team](https://srobo.github.io/kitbook/kit-team/#brain-team)!

The physical contents of the kit has a huge impact on the competition, and it is the Hardware Strategy team's responsibility to work out what it should be.  If you are interested in shaping the future of the SR hardware (both mechanical and/or electronic), then the [Hardware Strategy team](https://srobo.github.io/kitbook/kit-team/#hardware-strategy-team) is for you! 

For information on what our teams do, please find their description in the [kitbook](https://srobo.github.io/kitbook/kit-team/).

Thanks,

The Kit Team
