Hi all,

In light of recent events, and the uncertainty it has brought, we're unfortunately cancelling the in-person competition for Student Robotics 2020.

## Virtual Competition

The virtual competition event will take place over a few weekend sessions in July, with a few weekends of league matches, and a knockout final.

As we said in the previous email, we aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to Two Colours as possible so teams can easily build on the work done since Kickstart.

We will be announcing the full details of the virtual competition early next week.

For more information, please read our [latest news post](https://studentrobotics.org/news/2020-05-22-virtual-competition-transition/), and you can always find the latest updates on our [COVID-19 updates page](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/).

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](competition-team@studentrobotics.org)!
