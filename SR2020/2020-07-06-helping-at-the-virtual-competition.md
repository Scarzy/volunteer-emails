#### Simulation runner

You would be loading team code into the simulator then recording the output.
This recording will be handed over to the mixer so the commentators can react live.
Ideally you would have a reasonably powerful machine to run the simulations on.

#### Commentator

You would be commentating on the matches live in a similar way to the physical competition.

#### Video mixer / streamer

You would be the hub for the stream, playing the simulation recordings to the commentators and mixing the output live to YouTube.
Ideally you will have a stable and fast internet connection, and a reasonably powerful machine.

#### Scorer

You will determine each team's score at the end of a match.

#### In-chat mentors

You will be in the live-stream chat and on the forum to answer questions on the day.
Knowledge of our simualator and Python in general is handy for this role.
