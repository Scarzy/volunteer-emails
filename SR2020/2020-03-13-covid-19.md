Hello everyone,

I'm sure you've heard about the COVID-19 coronavirus, and about many large events being cancelled due to concerns of spreading the virus.

We're keeping a keen eye on the situation, and will be following the advice of the [UK Department of Health and Social Care][uk-coronavirus-page]. Considering this is an event for minors, we will be taking decisions with an abundance of caution.

We have put together a page on our website expanding further on how we're assessing the situation. You can find it here: https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/

We will be keeping this page up to date as things progress. As it stands the competition is going ahead as planned, however should this change, we will let you know as soon as we can. The only things that will stop us are:

- If the government says we can't/shouldn't proceed
- If the venue cancels our booking
- If we can't get enough teams to come
- If we can't get enough volunteers to come
- We don't think we can offer a safe event

We expect all those attending the competition to follow the [guidelines][phe-guidelines] on COVID-19 from Public Health England.

With that in mind, we'd like to confirm the opinions of our volunteers, to ensure we make the best, most informed decision.

Could you please fill out the below, 2 question survey around your stance on volunteering for SR2020:

If you have any questions about our handling of the event, please don't hesitate to contact us at competition-team@studentrobotics.org.
