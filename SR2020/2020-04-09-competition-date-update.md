Hi all,

After surveying our SR2020 teams and volunteers, we have selected the **weekend of the 4th July 2020** to be the most appropriate date for the competition.

The COVID-19 situation changes often, so we will re-evaluate in mid-May. At this time we'll evaluate the viability of running a competition.

## Virtual Competition

We are also considering a virtual competition, and are exploring possibilities of how this could work. This virtual competition would likely be held over a few weeks around late May / early June. We aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to Two Colours as possible.

You can still find the latest updates on our [COVID-19 updates page](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/).
