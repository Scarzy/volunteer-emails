Hi all,

### Tech Days

We are going to be hosting a couple of Tech Days in February, and we would love for you to come along and help us out:

- [Southampton on the 8th Feb][soton-tech-day]
- [London on the 29th Feb][london-tech-day]

Tech Days are fairly casual events we host for the teams to spend a day working
on their robots surrounded by volunteers and other teams. They are a great
opportunity to meet and work with other volunteers as well as see how the teams
are progressing. Tech Days are all day events (usually on a Saturday), though if
you can only make a part of the day that’s fine.

There’s no need to worry if you don’t know much about the kit or the robots --
Tech Days are a great place to learn about both by working alongside other
volunteers. Just asking the teams to explain what they’re working on and
providing a friendly outside perspective is really helpful.

As an added benefit, Tech Days are also generally a good time for us to get on with the [tasks][github-tasks] which need to be completed in the lead up to the competition.

If you're interested, please [sign up][tech-day-signup] so we have an idea of numbers. :)

### Helping out remotely

We have created a [list of the tasks][github-tasks] which need doing in order to make the competition happen. If you’d like to get involved (even small contributions really help), please [join us][slack-signup] in our [Slack][slack].
