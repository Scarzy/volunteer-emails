subject: How you can help with our virtual competition
---

Hi all,

## This Saturday (4th July) - our dry run competition

First of all, we're doing a dry run of the whole simulation running, rendering, livestreaming and commentary process **this Saturday at 1PM**.

If you have some time this week, we would love for you to write some robot code which we will put head-to-head against other volunteers in our simulated arena on Saturday.

## The Virtual Competition

We are running the virtual competition over 3 weekends. Exact timings will be coming after our dry run.

Weekend                | Matches
-----------------------|---------
11th - 12th July 2020  | League
18th - 19th July 2020  | League
25th - 26th July 2020  | Knockout

**We need your help to ensure this is as successful as possible**

### Team Interviews

We would love to record some video interviews with teams in advance to talk through their strategy, physical robot design and more.

We've identified two main roles for this:

- Interviewer - we will provide some prompts and a general overview of what needs
- Video editor - to take the interview footage and edit to be played on the live-stream

### Roles for the competition days

For all roles, you will be briefed with further details - don't be afraid to sign up!

#### Simulation runner

You would be loading team code into the simulator then recording the output. 
This recording will be handed over to the mixer so the commentators can react live. 
Ideally you would have a reasonably powerful machine to run the simulations on.

#### Commentator

You would be commentating on the matches live in a similar way to the physical competition.

#### Video mixer / streamer

You would be the hub for the stream, playing the simulation recordings to the commentators and mixing the output live to YouTube.
Ideally you will have a stable and fast internet connection, and a reasonably powerful machine.

#### Scorer

You will determine each team's score at the end of a match.

#### Judge

Handles all judging decisions and has the final word on team scores in the case of a dispute.

#### In-chat mentors

You will be in the live-stream chat and on the forum to answer questions on the day.
Knowledge of our simualator and Python in general is handy for this role.

## Sign up

**If you are interested to fill any of these roles, please [sign up](https://forms.gle/zdSoX35KRqip2VA9A).**
We will brief you on your role and our safeguarding policies once your role has been assigned.
