Hello all,

Quick update on the volunteering opportunities:

## We still need volunteers for the competition!

The dates will be April 18th - 19th, with set-up days on the 16th and 17th if you’re available! The venue is RUSU, the University of Reading Student Union. See more on the website in the [competition event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/competition/).

Accommodation will be provided for volunteers, and we’ll provide lunch on the competition days. We may also reimburse travel depending on the budget, so keep your travel receipts!

If you'd like to volunteer, please sign up here: https://forms.gle/foHy82uY98wiPm587

**The deadline for applying to ensure you get accommodation is March 14th!!**

## Helping with Tech Days

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available from us. They’re also an opportunity for us, as volunteers, to meet and get to know other people who volunteer with the competition.

The next tech days coming up will be on:

| Date | Location |
| ---- | -------- |
| February 29th | [London (Thread, Whitechapel)](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/london-tech-day-february/) |
| March 7th | [University of Southampton](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/southampton-tech-day-march/) |
| March 28th | [London (Thread, Whitechapel)](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2020/london-tech-day-march/) |

If you’re free to help out on a tech day, then [sign up to attend](https://forms.gle/G2p2b37sezyFEriUA)! The events pages have all the details. Don’t worry if you’re new, we’d be happy to help you out with assisting teams or doing other things for the competition!

Thanks,
-- The Student Robotics Competition Team
