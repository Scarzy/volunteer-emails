Hello all,

Following guidance from the UK government and the University of Reading, we will need to postpone Student Robotics 2020 Competition from the original date in April, until some time late June / early July.

## Competition

We are currently investigating the following dates for the competition:

- 27th - 28th June
- 4th - 5th July
- 11th - 12th July

Please fill in the following poll to let us know your preferred dates: https://forms.gle/7tGnPQSSpVhLBN4g7

The event will still take place over a weekend, at the University of Reading.

We hope to confirm the updated date in the next week, so please let us know as soon as you can.

## Tech Days

There are no current planned tech days. Once things have settled down, we hope to organise some.

If you have any further questions, please let us know on competition-team@studentrobotics.org.
