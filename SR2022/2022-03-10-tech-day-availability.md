subject: Help wanted for an in-person Tech Day
---

Hi,

We're in the process of planning and booking venues for in-person Tech Days on
the 26th March or 2nd April 2022.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They also provide an opportunity to see how
the teams are progressing and ensure they get the most out of their experience
in Student Robotics.

As a volunteer they're great opportunities for you to see how the teams are
doing and gain experience both with the kits and with supporting teams, while
being supported by other volunteers. No prior experience is needed.

If you could be available and would like to help at one of the in-person Tech
Days we're planning please fill in this form to let us know where and when
you're available:

Having enough volunteers is important to ensure the Tech Days provide value to
the teams.

We're hoping to finalise the dates & venues in the next week, so if you could be
available please let us know soon.
