Hi All,

We're starting the SR2022 competition cycle and we need your help!

## Refreshed team structure

As you may already have seen, we have five main teams within the organisation. If any of these sounds interesting then please feel free to join one of the regular meetings in the [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon)
and check out the relevant channels in our [Slack](SLACK LINK HERE).
We appreciate any help you can provide, whether that's taking on a couple of tasks or just joining the occasional meeting to say hello and get a feel for what's going on.

The new teams are:

### Kit Team

Supporting the current kit which is provided to competitors and developing the next generation.

Led by: Karina Kwiatek, Dan Trickey

### Competition Team

Shaping this year's competition including the game, the venue, and managing the teams.

Led by: Andy Busse, Andy Barrett-Sprott, Jenny Fletcher

### Marketing Team

Promoting Student Robotics to Sponsors, Volunteers, and Competitors via our website and social media.

Led by: Antoine Petty, James Seden Smith

### Fundraising Team

Engaging with current and prospective sponsors of Student Robotics.

Key members: Jenny Fletcher, Holly Holder

If you have any contacts in companies who may be able to sponsor us, feel free to reach out or pass the contact details to someone on the fundraising team

### Infrastruture Team

Maintain the technical infrastructure required to support the activities of Student Robotics.
Led by: Peter Law, Jake Howard

The infrastructure team will be meeting on a monthly basis with the meeting details avaliable on the SR calendar. If you're interested in what the team will get up to, feel free to join the [#infrastructure](https://studentrobotics.slack.com/archives/C02BXUAK33M) channel in Slack. If you'd like to get more involved in the team then please respond to [our poll](https://doodle.com/poll/ncivi35z5wxm2qbn) to help us find a regular time slot.

## Student Robotics 2022 Competition

Now, while we've still got a fair bit of work to do, here are our plans for the year ahead.
* We're planning on a return to a more normal looking competition, with physical robots back this year.
* We're also planning to return to running in-person events. Due to a very restricted budget this year it's unlikely we'll be able to run a full-sized competition. What this will likely mean in practice is some "tech day" sized events with a smaller number of teams attending, but with all teams expected to attend a "finals" event.
* We're expecting to run an online kickstart in late October / early November (i.e. after half term).
* This also means the challenge will be designed to fit within a classroom sized space.
* The simulator-based activities have worked rather well over the last couple of years - this will be included in a meaningful way into this year's competition.

### Mentoring

Our teams have had a couple of years of purely virtual competitions so may need a little more support getting to grips with our kit and robot-building again.
This is an easy way to make a big difference for our competitors to boost their skills and confidence, even if you're fairly new to volunteering.
If you'd like to get involved, please let the competition team know!

### Kit Packing

We're planning to hold a kit-packing weekend in early October - keep an eye out for another email from the kit team soon!

## Website Overhaul

We're in the process of giving our website a fresh lick of paint (you may have already seen our [new sponsor page](https://studentrobotics.org/sponsor/?utm_source=volunteer-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2021-09-25-start-of-comp-cycle) ).
If you have an interest or experience with design or video editing, the marketing team would love to hear from you. You don't need any particularly technical skills to get involved. :)

## Sponsors

We are very pleased to announce that we have two new sponsors:
* [Adventurous Machines](https://adventurousmachines.com/?ref=studentrobotics)
* [Hills Road Sixth Form College](https://www.hillsroad.ac.uk/)


We look forward to seeing you soon
