Hi,

Thank you for agreeing to help out at the SR2022 competition!

A few bits of information to be aware of:


## Venue opening times
The venue doors will open at ??:??, with competitors arriving from 09:00. There will be some briefings and some preparation ahead of the competitors arriving, so please arrive promptly.

## Volunteer schedule
Please check the [volunteer schedule]() to see what roles you've been allocated. Role descriptions can be found [here](). Please read the descriptions for the roles you've been allocated to ensure you know what your jobs will entail.

## Media Consent
You will have to complete a [Media Consent form](https://studentrobotics.org/resources/sr2022/media-consent.pdf). If you are able to complete this ahead of time that will be appreciated. There will be a few spare media consent forms available.

## Reimbursements
If you have made any expenditures for the competition, please remember to claim your money back. Please speak to the competition team committee about approving refunds.

Unfortunately we are unable to cover expenses for getting to the competition this year.

## Safeguarding
All volunteers are required to read the [safeguarding policy](https://opsmanual.studentrobotics.org/about-the-charity/safeguarding). Please ensure you have read this ahead of time, and e-mail safeguarding@studentrobotics.org to confirm you have read and understood it.

## Refreshments
Hot drinks, cold drinks, and snacks will be available throughout the competition and the setup days. If possible, please bring a re-usable mug to make your drinks in so we can limit waste. You will need to provide your own lunch.

## Southampton Marathon

On Sunday 24th April, a marathon event is being held in Southampton. As a result there will be a number of road closures in the area, including on the university campus. Parking will also be limited. Keep an eye on the [competition event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/competition/) on our website to see up-to-date information on how to reach the competition. There may be some time changes to account for this, and some restrictions on which car parks are available.

Please note that this also means that access to food sellers may be restricted, so please plan accordingly.

## T-Shirts
As always, t-shirts have been ordered for all volunteers. These will be available when you arrive on the Saturday.

## COVID Safety

Life is beginning to get back to normal, and this means we are finally able to do in person events again! However, we must recognise that some people still have to be cautious, to protect their own health or their friends or family. As such, we ask that everyone follows [our COVID policy](https://studentrobotics.org/covid-19/) to help ensure we all keep safe, whilst still having lots of fun with robots!

Please keep an eye on this as we get closer to the competition, as the content may change. There are also some changes for the setup days, if you are attending the setup days please speak to someone on arrival to check what is required.


Further information on many of these points can be found on the [competition event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/competition/), so keep an eye on this for updates. We welcome questions, so please feel free to ask if you need clarification on anything!

Thanks for all your help! We look forward to seeing you at the competition!
