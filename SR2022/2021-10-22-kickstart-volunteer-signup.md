Hi All,

We're running Kickstart a little differently this year. The Kickstart event will be livestreamed to all teams on Saturday 13th November 2021.

We would like to run sessions to check the kits are in working order, assist with micro-games, and be there to answer any questions from the team. Some of these will be on the day, and some in the following few weeks, both virtually and in-person depending on team and volunteer availability.

If you'd like to give our teams a headstart and get involved with these sessions, please [sign up and let us know your availability](https://forms.gle/2ZUg8YL6Wv1yR5wj6).

We can't wait to get SR2022 kicked off!
