Hi All,

Every year we kick off the competition with a Kickstart event. This is where we introduce the year's game to our teams and present them with the kit they'll use to build their bots. All teams are also given some micro-games to complete: relatively simple tasks to get them acquainted with their new kit in both hardware and software.
We're running Kickstart a little differently this year, livestreaming it to all teams on Saturday 13th November 2021 instead of our typical in-person event. (See more info on the [Kickstart event page](https://studentrobotics.org/events/sr2022/kickstart/?utm_source=volunteer-email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=kickstart-recruitment))

We would like to run sessions to check the kits are in working order, assist with micro-games, and be there to answer any questions from the team. Some of these will be on the day, and some in the following few weeks, both virtually and in-person depending on team and volunteer availability.

**If you'd like to give our teams a head start and get involved with these sessions, please [sign up and let us know your availability](https://forms.gle/2ZUg8YL6Wv1yR5wj6).**

We can't wait to get SR2022 kicked off!
