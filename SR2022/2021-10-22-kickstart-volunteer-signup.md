Hi All,

Every year we kick off the competition with a Kickstart event. This is where we introduce the year's game to our teams and present them with the kit they'll use to build their bots. All teams are also micro-games: relatively simple tasks to get them aquainted with their new kit in both hardware and software.
We're running Kickstart a little differently this year, livestreaming it to all teams on Saturday 13th November 2021 instead of our typical in-person event.

We would like to run sessions to check the kits are in working order, assist with micro-games, and be there to answer any questions from the team. Some of these will be on the day, and some in the following few weeks, both virtually and in-person depending on team and volunteer availability.

If you'd like to give our teams a headstart and get involved with these sessions, please [sign up and let us know your availability](https://forms.gle/2ZUg8YL6Wv1yR5wj6).

We can't wait to get SR2022 kicked off!
